A simple python script to parse gamelist.xml files and output what tags are missing from each game found.

Usage: ```python parser.py``` and type your roms directory e.g. ```\\RG351P\roms```. The script will only scan the first subdirectory, not nested subdirectories. Look for output.txt files in a folder created next to wherever you put parser.py.
